# Io and Kayleigh's Sex Menu Card Game
A card game created by Io Sparks and Kayleigh Brooking. 

The game is a fun way to build a sexy/kinky scenario for you 
and your partners to have fun playing with. Our version is 
very switch focused, so we have opensourced this personal 
project to help the sex positive community have more 
tools in the pursuit of being able to ask for what we want.  

# A Foundation of Consent & Creativity
**Expand Your Menu:** This game is designed to be personalised 
and expanded. The opensource nature of the game means we 
welcome people to add to our deck of cards with their own.
We would love nothing more than to see what you can come up 
with. Feel free to create your own cards for specific kinks, 
items, locations, or even rules to add to your deck.

**Communication is Key:** The goal is collaborative creation. 
Building the scene should be a discussion. Unless you 
have a pre-negotiated dynamic that includes surprises, 
planning the scene together is a vital and fun 
part of the game.

**Further Education:** We encourage all players to be 
educated on the principles of enthusiastic consent. 
We recommend seeking out resources to ensure your play is 
as safe, fun, and fulfilling as possible.

Here are some resources to get you started:

# How to Play
Welcome to a new way to play. This game is a collaborative 
tool designed for anyone—couples or groups—who wants to 
connect and explore intimacy in a fun, consensual, and 
creative way. There are no winners or losers, unless you want 
there to be; the goal is to work together to build a 
unique and exciting intimate scene.

The game is flexible. It can be a lighthearted tool for a new 
couple trying something different, or a framework for 
experienced kinksters to craft an elaborate scenario. 
The power is in your hands.

A Note on Intimacy & Play: For Ace/Demi & All Players
The goal of this game is consensual, fulfilling connection. 
For many, this may be sexual, but it absolutely does not 
have to be. A "scene" can be sensual, romantic, platonic, 
emotionally intense, or focused on power exchange—with 
or without any sexual component.

"Sex" is always optional, just as any other activity is. 
The power to define your play lies in the "Golden Rule" 
step below. When building your "Hell Yes" deck, you and 
your fellow players decide what intimacy looks like 
for you. You can create a deck that is entirely 
non-sexual, focusing on cards like Massage, Sensory, 
Praise/Worship, or Rope while leaving out others. 
This game is a menu, and you are in complete control of 
what gets served.

**The Golden Rule:** Building Your "Hell Yes" Deck
This is the most important step. Before you play for the 
first time, you and all other players must go through 
every single card in the box together.

Create a single "Play Deck" for each card type 
(Location, Category, Item) that consists only of cards 
that everyone gives an enthusiastic "Hell Yes!" to. 
If any player feels a "no" or even a "maybe" about a card, 
it does not go into the Play Deck.

This process ensures that every possible outcome of the game 
is something everyone has already consented to and is 
excited about. The foundation of this game is 
enthusiastic consent, and this step makes it a reality.

## Game Setup
**Prepare Your Decks:** Take your pre-approved "Hell Yes" 
decks of Location, Category, and Item cards. Shuffle 
each deck individually and place them face down on the table.

**Reference Cards:** Place the two Rule cards 
("Switch!" and "Picking Your Play") face up on the table 
for everyone to see.

**Get Your Dice:** You will need one of each of the following 
dice: a 4-sided die (D4), an 8-sided die (D8), and 
a 20-sided die (D20).

## How to Play: 

### Crafting Your Scene

**Step 1: Determine Roles (Optional)**
This step is for players who enjoy "switch" dynamics 
(moving between dominant/submissive or top/bottom roles). 
If you have established roles, you can skip this.

Refer to the "Switch!" Rule card.

**_For two players:_** Flip a coin. The winner gets to share 
their preference first on whether they wish to lead the 
scene (Top/Dom) or follow (Bottom/Sub). This is the start 
of a conversation, not a final decision.

**_For more than two players:_** You can either do an 
elimination-style coin flip until one person is left 
standing, or simply discuss roles as a group. 
If an existing dynamic is in place, you may defer to that.

**Step 2: Roll for Your Ingredients** 
One player rolls the dice to 
determine how many cards to 
draw for the scene's "menu." Refer to the 
"Picking your Play" Rule card:

**Location:** Roll the D4.

If the result is odd (1 or 3), draw one Location card.

If the result is even (2 or 4), draw two Location cards.

**Category:** Roll the D8. Draw that number of Category cards.

**Item:** Roll the D20. Draw that number of Item cards.

**Step 3: Lay Out The Menu**
Place all the cards you have just drawn face up in the 
centre of the table for all players to see. This is your 
"menu" of potential ingredients for the scene.

**Step 4: Choose Your Style of Play**
Now that you see your ingredients, you must decide as a group 
how you want to build your meal. 
There are two ways to play:

**_A) Menu Play (The À La Carte Experience)_**

Discuss the drawn cards together. As a group, choose the 
ones you want to incorporate into your scene. You don't 
have to use all of them. This mode is great for crafting a 
specific, tailored experience based on the group's mood.

**_B) Challenge Play (The Chef's Tasting Menu)_** 
_Our Favourite way to play_

You must use every single card drawn in your scene. 
This mode encourages creativity, problem-solving, and 
finding exciting ways to combine potentially conflicting 
themes. It’s a fun challenge to expand your horizons.

**Step 5: Build Your Scene**
This is the heart of the game. Talk through the cards 
you've chosen. How do they connect? What story do 
they tell? Plan out your scene together, discussing limits, 
desires, and the flow of the experience. The more you 
communicate here, the better the scene will be.

### Special Card Explanations
Some cards have rules that change the game. If you draw 
them, their rules apply:

Category Card "Times Up!"

If this card is part of your scene, the roles will switch 
during play. Before you begin, roll a D6. The result is 
the number of minutes before the person(s) leading the scene 
must switch roles with the person(s) following.

Item Card "None"

If this card is drawn, it overrides and cancels out all 
other Item cards drawn with it. Discard all Item cards. 
Your scene will use no items other than what you might find 
naturally at your chosen Location.
