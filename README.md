# SexMenuCardGame
A card game created by Io Sparks and Kayleigh Brooking. The game is a fun way to build a sexy/kinky scenario for you and your partners to have fun playing with. Our version is very switch focused, so we have opensourced this personal project to help the sex positive community have more tools in the pursuit of being able to ask for what we want.
